# OpenGL_Rendering_OBJ_files
This is a c++ program using openGL to render and texture .OBJ files that could be imported from blender. 
Current implementation allows to render and texture ANY 4 objects, but is going to be updated to be able to render more objects.  
Only the source code + .obj file + textures are included, all the libraries required for OpenGL need to be configured separately, 
since the uploaded file would be too large.

(Requires: glew + glm + sfml)

The program allows to render a loaded .obj file "room.obj" included as an example. 
You can freely move arround the scene by using keyboard arrows and mouse.
